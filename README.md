TrainSchedule
=============

A simple training schedule for runners and bikers.

You can:
 
* record your biking and running times/distances every week
* trace our tour on a map
* use basically the same functionality as pedometer (automatic routing)
* save and insert segments of frequently used routes to speed up tracing
* overview training data in a table
