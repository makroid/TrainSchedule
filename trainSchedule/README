TrainSchedule
is a simple QT application for training monitoring.
On each day of a week, sessions can be added. Typically, a session consists of a type (e.g. bike-session), 
a duration and a distance. Optionally, the corresponding route can be visualized via google maps in a 
pedometer-like interface.

You need QT and QT's webkit installed for compilation.
